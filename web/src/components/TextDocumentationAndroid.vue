      These instructions are for people wanting to use an Android based OS to keep their duckdns record up-to date . <br>

      You could simply have an old android device - connected to your home network keeping your DuckDNS record up-to date, or you may run some service on your android device on a mobile network and want to reach it by a duckdns domain. <br>

      The client is provided by <a href="http://www.etx.ca/" class="link">http://www.etx.ca/</a> and is download-able from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckdns.updater">Play Market</a> as you would expect.
