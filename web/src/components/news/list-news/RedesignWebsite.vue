            We have had an exchange of emails from the Reddit Legal team.
            They extended the switch off date to the <a class="font-bold">8 March 2021</a>, we have now took down the ability to login with Reddit oAuth.
            You are still able to login with your reddit name and token, however we reccomend moving off Reddit Login, by deleting your domains and re-adding them to another login.
            If you lose your token or forget your token, we have no-way of giving you access.
