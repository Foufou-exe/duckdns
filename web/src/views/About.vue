        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Why do I need a dynamic DNS service</h3>
        <p class="font-thin">
            DDNS is a handy way for you to refer to a server/router with an easily rememberable name, where the servers ip address is likely to change
            when your router reconnects, or ec2 server reboots, its ip address is set by the provider of that connection, this means it may update at any time
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Why make a free DDNS service?</h3>
        <p class="font-thin">Because we can, because before we started we couldn't, learning is fun</p>
